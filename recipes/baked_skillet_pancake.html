    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked skillet pancake is an old family recipe, and it is not your ordinary pancake. It tastes almost like the elephant ears you get at the fair. So good!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioner's sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a large cast iron skillet in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Add butter to skillet to melt a few minutes before preheating is complete.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour and milk together in a bowl. Whisk in eggs. Batter will be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove skillet from oven; pour batter into the hot skillet over melted butter.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until lightly golden and crispy around edges, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dust with confectionerâ€™s sugar and cinnamon, as desired, while still warm.</li>
    </ol>
